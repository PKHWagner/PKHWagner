### Hi there 👋

Philipp Wagner is the name. Coding is my new game! 👨‍💻</br>
About to graduate Coding Dojo Bootcamp 🥷, passing both MERN and Python Stacks. 🫠</br>
My coding journey has just begun and there is so much to learn. 📕 📗 📘 📙 📚</br>
The goal is to become a remote Dev, living in remote Alaska makes going into a office hard. 🏔 🌨</br>
I love design and front end but my strength showed to be backend. 🙈 🙉 🙊</br>
My passions are Family 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦, Snowboarding 🏂, Skating 🛹, Soccer ⚽, cooking 🍜 and the enviroment 🐳</br>

Don't be a stranger, I love meeting new people!
